# handsfree-control

A voice-controlled robot utilizing *Blynk app*, *IFTTT*, and *Google Assistant*, providing a hands-free control solution for drivers to enhance road safety through IoT integration.

### Methodology & Observation:
The system allows users to control a wireless robot using voice commands, aiming to offer a reliable and intuitive method for interacting with the robot in its environment. Arduino is employed to set up the sensors, while IFTTT and Google Assistant handle voice control commands. The Blynk app serves as the remote control, enabling users to enjoy a convenient and efficient hands-free experience through voice interactions with the device. 

### Result:
This project's notable advantage lies in enhancing road safety by reducing driver distraction. By enabling drivers to maintain control of the car through voice commands while keeping their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road, it minimizes the risk of accidents caused by distractions.
